\section{Object detection models}
\label{sec:results_obj}

What happens when using different object detection models. Preference for using a pre-trained one vs training one myself.

\section{Word2vec model}
\label{sec:results_word2vec}

\section{Fuzzy memberships}
\label{sec:results_fuzzy}

What happens when using different fuzzy memberships (changing main words etc.)

\section{Scaler}
\label{sec:results_scaler}

\section{Random starting points}
To improve variety, maybe use random points in close vicinity of input picture.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:results_eval}

Methodology used for evaluation. Maybe some precision functions such as P@K or MAP, although P@K is much more versatile.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:results_discussion}

Discussion on the results obtained
