\chapter{Object detection}
\label{chap:obj}

This chapter is for cnn and object recognition

\section{What is object detection?}
\label{sec:obj_what}

What is?

\section{Neural networks}
\label{sec:obj_nn}

What are neural networks in general, how do they work, some graphic or something

\section{Convolutional Neural Networks}
\label{sec:obj_cnn}

By what do cnn differ from other types of neural networks. Why are they special.

\subsection{Convolution operator}
\label{sec:obj_cnn_conv}

Main characteristic of the cnn is the convolution operation

\subsection{Pooling}
\label{sec:obj_cnn_pooling}

Pooling methods: average, max

\section{Residual networks}
\label{sec:obj_resnet}

This is a section dedicated to Residual networks \cite{resnet}
