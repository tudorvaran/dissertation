\section{Future work}
\label{sec:conclusion_future}

What to improve. Mention scaler if haven't enough time to use it. Mention random points if haven't time to use them. Always to improve: membership words or object detection. 

Mention inclusion of face detection to show only pictures of a certain face. There are libraries but you were lazy to include them and since this more computer vision it's not the place to use them (since it adds a whole chapter on computer vision in the paper)
